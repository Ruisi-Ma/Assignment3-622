The pregnancy test wasn't positive until late, day 34, which my sister said was a sign with her miscarriage. Then I only ended up having one day of nausea. I thought maybe I was just one of the lucky ones that wasn't going to be constantly sick, but I woke up today with light spotting and then mild cramping all day. My heart is absolutely breaking thinking of my little baby. I feel lost. I want to be hopeful for the future, but I just wanted this baby...

Last week on tuesday l went for an ultrasound and they could only see the sac, no yolk or embryo. The doctor said that l can come back 2-3 weeks later. (This was done at a private hospital)

The last few days l got very sick (like a nasty cold) so l went to the urgent care this evening and they did an ultrasound and they could also only see the sac, nothing else. (This was done at the government hospital and the equipment looked a bit older l guess ?)

However, should l be worried? l do have the typical symptons (no vomiting though) and l think my ovultion might have been very late.

When is the best time to go for the next ultrasound? lm scared that if l go too early l will be disappointed again but l also find it difficult to wait for a while.

Both times were done by external ultrasound and didnt experience any spotting, etc.",pregnant,,,14,Sat,2025-03-15,110,Irrelevant

2025-03-14,2025-03-13 23:38:47,How accurate were your gender dreams? (TW: Loss),"I just gotta know the accuracy. I had a loss in October and even though I DESPERATELY wanted a girl, I found out it was a boy. Sadly it ended in loss in my second trimester (doctors suspect he had heart failure). The strange thing is even if I wanted a girl, I dreamt of a baby boy that was almost sickly in all my dreams. Its strange how accurate that was. He was never very active in my ultrasounds and was always sort of slumped over not looking well.





This time I want a boy due to my loss, but Im having dreams of a girl. More specifically a girl thats really lively, talks back to me, and doesnt listen =C And when I punish her she laughs at me. I got an ultrasound a couple days later after the dream and sure enough this kid is bouncing and wiggling everywhere =, Its cute, but I feel like the personality is going to be accurate. Its a lot more lively than my previous baby was.





My mom has been convinced since I was a child that if I ever have a child Ill only have one (shes right with that because I decided one and done) and itd be a boy. So far she hasnt been wrong with any of her grandkids so I feel like the odds are its a boy, but my gut and dreams are saying its a girl this time = Partner has 2 boys only from a previous marriage and the third would have also been a boy, so what are the odds?

2025-03-15,2025-03-15 16:21:26,"Do Women Have a Moral Duty to Keep Their Bodies ""Ready"" for Reproduction at All Times?","Late last year, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts (Aid Access, Women on Waves) announced results of a large clinical trial in Moldova, testing the use of a weekly low dose of mifepristone (50 mg) as a contraceptive. The results were promising, with only one pregnancy occurring within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, negative side effects were minimal, with only 4% of the participants experiencing any negative side effects (compared to a 40% negative side effect rate for conventional hormonal contraceptives). Additionally, the low-dose mifepristone was easier to use, requiring only one dose a week, and being more ""forgiving"" of variations in the time the pill is taken. And 89% of the study participants reported that they stopped menstruating while taking mifepristone as a contraceptive. (Probably most women would consider this a positive side effect.)

Because of the positive results, the trials have been expanded to the Netherlands this year. If the results continue to be positive, the plan is to apply to the European Medicines Agency for registration and market authorization to allow this weekly, low-dose mifepristone regimen as a contraceptive throughout the EU.

The method of action for mifepristone as birth control is two-fold: it reduces the rate of ovulation and it thins the endometrial lining of the uterus, making it impossible for a fertilized egg to implant.

([Source](https://msmagazine.com/2025/01/07/mifepristone-weekly-contraceptive-clinical-trials-abortion-pill-birth-control/).)

My primary question for PL supporters is this: 

* Would you have any moral or legal objections to women's use of such a contraceptive? If so, on what grounds?

Here are some secondary questions if you believe that the use of this contraceptive would be immoral:

* If a woman was taking mifepristone as described here *as a contraceptive* and informed her partner that she was doing this before they had sex, and if her partner, knowing this, decided to go ahead and have PIV sex with her, and if one of his sperm fertilized an egg but it failed to implant, whose would be the primary responsibility for the ""death"" of the fertilized egg? (Realistically, neither of them would ever know if this happened, so this is a hypothetical question.)
* *Men's* use of tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, red meat, and food high in trans fats during the months before their partners' conception is associated with higher miscarriage rates, because of these substances' impacts on sperm. ([Source](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/a-mans-unhealthy-lifestyle-too-can-lead-to-his-partners-pregnancy-loss/articleshow/64072130.cms?from=mdr).)  If men engage in such unhealthy lifestyles, they are not maintaining their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction, and their choices could result in the ""death"" of a fertilized egg or even an embryo or fetus. Do they have a moral duty to maintain their bodies in a state ""ready"" for reproduction by refraining from such lifestyle choices?",Abortiondebate,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jc47ep/do_women_have_a_moral_duty_to_keep_their_bodies/,16,Sat,2025-03-15,74,Neutral

Im currently 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my first baby. After my first prenatal appointment, I received unexpected news from my employer that we need to return to the office after nearly three years of working remotely. I was devastated because I had hoped to work from home during my pregnancy and through my babys first year, but here we are.

I spoke with my doctor about it, and she gave me some great advice to make the transition easier, like treating myself to lunch nearby, listening to my favorite podcast on the commute, and finding small ways to make the experience more pleasant. That helped me mentally prepare, but Im still struggling with first-trimester fatigue, sleepiness, food aversions, and all the fun symptoms that come with early pregnancy. I have been told things get better in the second trimester, so Im hopeful.

Now, I have the option to work either:

* 5 days a week, 8 hours a day
* 4 days a week, 10 hours a day with 3-day weekends

I would love to hear from others who have worked a flex schedule while pregnant. For context, I'm a software developer. My commute would be 45 - 60 minutes. Would working four longer days be worth it for the extra day off, or would the longer shifts be too exhausting? I understand that everyone is different and experiences may vary. I'd still love to learn about others' experiences or any advice especially if you've been in this exact situation.

Resembling the effects of eugenics, it reflects a societal bias against disabilities, effectively ""weeding out"" a specific genetic trait.

Eugenics per wikipedia: is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population -&gt;This in itself seems a good ""improving genetic quality of the human population""

Eugenics is stigmatized due to the racist evils of Nazi Germany, but it's goal of improving a populations health and other desirable characteristics is not evil in it's self.

It will obviously need to be controlled but once we can select and screen fetuses and embryos for positive characteristics such as good health (e.g. not having mental or physical illnesses), long life, physical strength, intelligence that will improve society we should and it can be argued it would be immoral to the next generation not to do so e.g. we are treating them poorly

Once genetic selection becomes  a societal norm similar to  how immunizing a child is expected today, It will be seem negligent to opt out, much like skipping vaccines is viewed now.

  
TLDR:  
Downs syndrome screening is eugenics "" a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population"".  
This itself is a good and is tainted by a history of racism and discrimination which doesn't need to apply to eugenics in future. Though obvious caution and safeguards should be applied

2025-03-15,2025-03-15 05:20:42,We both want abortion but my wife can't get over the fears from her beliefs. How can i help her?,"Hi guys,

I seriously need your help on this, and this is a long one.

We just got married, and we f'd up. We know this is our mistake and we are blaming ourselves for letting this happen.

My wife and I just found out she's pregnant a few days ago, just a month after our wedding. The scan we did yesterday didn't even show the embryo inside the uterus, so we still have time to decide what to do. It's very early. It's too early even to do a MA. Now our initial reaction and up to even now after a few days is that we are not ready to have kids. We still want to enjoy our lives and no matter how we go through the scenarios in our head and together, we can not imagine and cannot accept the reality that there will be a children in our life, at least at this time. We fully believe having a kid will more likely leave us with more suffering, and unhappiness. We've talked to great lengths about this and agree that we will be most happy and content with just each other.

But my wife is a firm believer in Buddhist teachings, and she believes that we'd be committing a major sin, akin to murder and she seems to be unable to overcome this to get the courage to make the final decision. And i don't know how to help her get through this. I believe that the decision we want to make will lead to less sufferings, and better for all parties involved. But I fear that if we decide to have an abortion, she will also not be happy and will be in tremendous mental pain and I don't know if she will even be able to heal from it.

We are also super torn due to the fact that other than our own selfish needs and the vision that we have for our life together, there's no other reason to have this abortion. We are happily in love, both our families are well off, incredibly kind, helpful to us and will be over the moon if we reveal to them about the pregnancy. There's no real financial strain to speak of to take care of the baby if we let this happen. In our culture people believe that having children is a blessing, so there's no chance of talking to anyone else in our families about this, because we will face massive judgements that will make it impossible to even speak about an abortion, so that leaves us alone to work this out.

I've tried to convince my wife that this is not a crime, and we are making this decision believing it will be best for our life together, that what ever is inside her right now is not yet a living human being, and if we make this decision with kindness in our hearts, there is no need to fear of guilt, karma or anything like that. But she is dismissing me everytime I mention it and doesnt want or unable to let go of her strong beliefs. I can see that she's in the middle of a crossroads and cannot find a way out that she can accept. She's in great pain, and I'm feeling it too.

Hi everyone,  

This is my first post, and I really need some opinions and support. In my community, theres a lot of stigma around elective C-sections, and its making me feel even more anxious about my decision.  

I am 32 years old from India currently living in Australia. Im currently 37 weeks pregnant with gestational diabetes but no other complications. I have a strong fear of vaginal delivery and have been leaning towards an elective C-section. My husband was initially supportive, but after our last appointment, where the doctor discussed the risks, he became a bit hesitant and asked me to rethink it. However, he reassured me that he would support my final decision.  

I also have my mom coming to help for three months postpartum, so I know Ill have support during recovery. Despite that, I cant shake the guilt and pressure from the stigma surrounding elective C-sections.  

Id love to hear from others whove been in a similar situation. How did you handle the decision? How was your recovery? And if youve faced judgment for choosing a C-section, how did you deal with it?

I ordered the pills online, it's my second abortion so I didn't go to a doctor, also just for the simple fact that I have state insurance and it's very hard to find a provider around me that covers the cost of an abortion.

But for the last 2 days, I have had cramping that is specifically on my left side. It radiates to my hip and I can feel it in my leg, butt and back as well. It feels just a tad bit more intense than my normal period cramps but nothing crazy. My bleeding has started lightening up over the past day or 2, but this cramping has just been so consistent over the past 2 days that I'm starting to worry. Last night I decided to take a pregnancy test just to make sure that my hcg levels were going down, but it still came back very positive.

I can say that I did see the sac come out when I had my abortion, so I know that my body dispelled SOMETHING. All of my bleeding was normal and everything had passed. I guess I'm just concerned about a potential ectopic pregnancy? I've never experienced one so I'm not sure what that pain would feel like. The cramping just feels very odd, especially for how directed it is in my left side and it's not just a general cramping feeling in my uterus.

One of them is obviously the media I consume. ""Custody of the eyes"" is easy and obvious when talking about content that is incredibly explicit or gratuitous in nature. It's best not to view it is a pretty easy conclusion to come to.

I find that when dealing with pure fantasy(Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragon Ball) of ""elseworlds"" so to speak...that entirely different world with an entirely different set of rules often ""Works"" for my rationalizing mind. A story about Samurai hunting monstrous demons hundreds of years ago, that clicks. Fantasy.

But surprisingly, I'm finding the sci-fi genre to have an inherently atheistic/Non-Christian view about most things. It is always so much about discovering alien life, or alien life being a given reality, presented in ways that feel like they sort of fly in the face of the Christian worldview and our understanding of Biblical history.

Meaning in the sense that they are often very pro Evolution, anti-God/Faith in lieu of putting ""science"" first, and even sometimes want to be filled with ""alternative explanations"" for the origins of life, creation, or deal with God-like beings that supplant the notion of ""God"" in our world and timeline.

I understand all movies are fictional ""what if"" scenarios...but I'm beginning to have annoyed moments when it comes to how some of these things get portrayed or addressed.

I'm not one to be overly prickly when it comes to things like this, but sometimes it just doesn't sit well with me in the genre of heavy sci-fi films, mentally reconciling what's being portrayed, stated, and implied on screen with the Biblical timeline or other Biblical truths of our world.

It ends up pushing my interest either completely into fantasy fiction like the aforementioned Dragon Ball or LOTR...or it makes me have a preference for more plausible, ""real world"" set action films like Mission Impossible and others like it.

I am getting through week 18 and out of the blue I started getting rashes after touching my dog. Specifically after she spends time leaning onto me (fur touching my arm or leg skin). 
My arm or thigh will get all red with bumps (looks exactly like an allergic reaction). This will not happened if I only touch her with the palms of my hand. 

I have lived with my pup for over 15 years and have never had any reactions to her. She gets bathed regularly and nothing has changed in how i take care of her. 
Could this be a pregnancy thing? Has this happened to any of you? Did you develop any weird new allergies while pregnant? Did they go away? 

My dog is a sweet 16 year old senile grandma and needs a lot of care and love which I plan on giving her until she crosses the rainbow. At the same time I dont want to turn get hurt or hurt my baby.

I went into the doctors and was excited to get a scan and confirmation that I was pregnant. She did the test and confirmed it and we got ready to do the ultrasound. She couldnt see anything on the first one so she said she would have to do a transvaginal ultrasound. Then nothing she said she saw nothing in my uterus or tubes. No egg sac no anything. I was heartbroken. She told me it could be a few things she said she could have either missed it and that she has missed three peoples babies and another clinic was able to pick them up. This clinic is within my insurance so I know people will say just go to another clinic but I dont have the means at the moment. Or she said it could still be an ectopic pregnancy and she would check hcg hormones and that I might need to go to the er today. It was all really really frighting and I was excited to see my baby today and now she has told me there is nothing on the scan.  Luckily I did not have to go to the er. My hcg levels were 856 and I have an appointment on Monday to see if they are lowering or going up.

2025-03-13,2025-03-13 18:47:00,Thinking of doing a C section. Traumatized from my last birth.,"I don't know if I really need advice or not.   
I plan on talking to my doctor tomorrow but I am struggling with my anxiety. 

I am currently 20w along with my second pregnancy. 

I first was great till the birth. Had him at 39+4 and he was semi big at 8lb 1oz. He also was sunny side up (nose facing my pelvis vs nose facing tail bone like normal) And for anyone that doesn't know that means that the widest part of the baby head is coming out first instead of the cone part of the head which is made to come out first. 

Him being born in that position caused me to tear in 3 locations all needing stitches and all VERY painful. I had the Epidural for my labor which also was a very long process for me as well but it only semi worked. i could feel contraction pain in my tail bone and my left butt cheek... they of course turned it off for the pushing part which lasted 2 1/2 hours for me. 

During my birth i was crying and saying i couldn't handle it anymore, i was in so much pain i wanted to quit. which i technically did as i stopped pushing myself though my body still naturally pushed and they had to help pull him out of me once his head came out. 

I feel as though I'm sort of traumatized and I'm having so much anxiety about giving birth again. I've told my husband that I am considering a C section as the cons of a c section sound way more worth it to me than going through a 24 hour labor, and 2+ plus hours of pushing and feeling like I'm giving up. 

I am aware a C section has a several month healing process, I'm aware of how the procedure works. What I maybe want is hearing other peoples experience. Did you choose to do a C section after a birth that scared you? what did you do to help with the anxiety of going through that pain again?",pregnant,,,18,Thu,2025-03-13,348,Neutral

Currently 12+4 with our < post IVF loss at 12+5 March of last year. As you can imagine Im struggling mentally and emotionally as the sense of loss never really goes away but of course grateful for this spontaneous pregnancy after TTC for 4yrs.

Starting Monday this week my nausea has essentially disappeared, breasts tender but not near as sore as they have consistently been. Im tired, and feel more bloated than normal. But feel like Im functioning more than I have been in the last three months. My nausea has kept me out of work several days in the last few weeks so the almost sudden absence is really sending me for a loop. 

Last year my symptoms also disappeared the 12th week and we found out at our appt at 12+5 wed had a silent miscarriage around the 11 week mark. There was a reason for the MC and this year our 8wk appt everything looked great. So Im of course just spinning at this point. Need to make it through the weekend on my own as hubby is visiting family and Im visiting mine, opposite directions. Monday is our NT scan.

2025-03-14,2025-03-14 04:39:24,Abortion Is Okay Because Its Their Choice,"At the end of the day, abortion is a personal decision, and no one should be forced to stay pregnant against their will. Pregnancy is a major medical event that affects a persons body, health, future, and life in ways that only they can fully understand. No one else has to experience the physical pain, the risks, the emotional toll, or the lifelong consequences of giving birthso why should anyone else get to decide?

Some argue that a fetus has a right to life, but even if we grant that, no one has the right to use another persons body without consent. We dont force people to donate organs, even if it would save a life. If bodily autonomy applies to everyone else, why should it suddenly stop applying to pregnant people?

People get abortions for all kinds of reasonsfinancial instability, medical risks, being too young, not wanting to be a parent, or simply not wanting to be pregnant. And they shouldnt have to justify it. No one is obligated to give up their body for someone else, and pregnancy should be no exception.

If someone believes abortion is wrong, they dont have to get one. But forcing others to stay pregnant against their will is not about valuing lifeits about controlling peoples bodies.",Abortiondebate,221.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Abortiondebate/comments/1jazbb9/abortion_is_okay_because_its_their_choice/,4,Fri,2025-03-14,42,Favor

We are keeping the sex of the baby a surprise but wanted to have plans for the names in either situation. My husband and I always been on the same page for the names but recently thats come into question. We originally agreed on Thomas Ike and Margaret (Maggie) May. There wasnt an inspiration behind either we just liked the names. 

So what changed? In January my grandfather died and while it was something we were expecting, it really rocked me. It made me think about how present he was in my life and how missed he is. Ive cried nearly every week since his death and it still hits me at random times and places. It really is such a strange thing to be grieving life while growing new life inside you. 

Due to this impact, I recently started thinking about changing our boy name to Thomas Lawrence Lawrence was my grandfathers middle name. I spoke to my husband about this thought and he said ultimately he would be on board if thats the route I want to move in but he feels like the recent grief is heavy on my heart and thats whats inspiring the name change. He is correct. But since the convo I really have no idea anymore. Ive sat on the question independently for about a month and still cant make up my mind. 

Im also worried because since Ive started telling people the names we have, that Ike is an atypical name. It normally makes people stop and question if we said Mike or just flat out misheard me. It makes me worry if we have a boy and I go with the original name that Im setting him up for a life of having to correct people.  

Should we change our boy name to Thomas Lawrence or keep the name as Thomas Ike?
